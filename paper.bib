	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations are a characteristic feature of neuronal activity and are typically investigated through measures of power and coherence. However, neither of these measures directly reﬂects the distinctive feature of oscillations: their rhythmicity. Rhythmicity is the extent to which future phases can be predicted from the present one. Here, we present lagged coherence, a frequency-indexed measure that quantiﬁes the rhythmicity of neuronal activity. We use this method to identify the sensorimotor alpha and beta rhythms in ongoing magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, and to study their attentional modulation. Using lagged coherence, the sensorimotor rhythms become visible in ongoing activity as local rhythmicity peaks that are separated from the strong posterior activity in the same frequency bands. In contrast, using conventional power analyses, the sensorimotor rhythms cannot be identiﬁed in ongoing data, nor can they be separated from the posterior activity. We go on to show that the attentional modulation of these rhythms is also evident in lagged coherence and moreover, that in contrast to power, it can be visualised even without an experimental contrast. These ﬁndings suggest that the rhythmicity of neuronal activity is better suited to identify neuronal oscillations than the power in the same frequency band.},

	abstract = {Neural oscillations are widely studied using methods based on the Fourier transform, which models data as sums of sinusoids. For decades these Fourier-based approaches have successfully uncovered links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, because of the fundamental sinusoidal basis, these methods might not fully capture neural oscillatory dynamics, because neural data are both nonsinusoidal and non-stationary. Here, we present a new analysis framework, complementary to Fourier analysis, that quantifies cycle-by-cycle time-domain features. For each cycle, the amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry are measured, the latter of which is missed using conventional approaches. Additionally, oscillatory bursts are algorithmically identified, allowing us to investigate the variability of oscillatory features within and between bursts. This approach is validated on simulated noisy signals with oscillatory bursts and outperforms conventional metrics. Further, these methods are applied to real data—including hippocampal theta, motor cortical beta, and visual cortical alpha—and can differentiate behavioral conditions.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic “background” 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters—along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth—are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.},

	abstract = {Background: Fourier-based techniques are used abundantly in the analysis of electrophysiological data. However, these techniques are of limited value when the signal of interest is non-sinusoidal or nonperiodic. New method: We present sliding window matching (SWM): a new data-driven method for discovering recurring temporal patterns in electrophysiological data. SWM is effective in detecting recurring but unknown patterns even when they appear non-periodically.
Results: To demonstrate this, we used SWM on oscillations in local ﬁeld potential (LFP) recordings from the rat hippocampus and monkey V1. The application of SWM yielded two interesting ﬁndings. We could show that rat hippocampal theta and monkey V1 gamma oscillations were both skewed (i.e. asymmetric in time), rather than being sinusoidal. Furthermore, gamma oscillations in monkey V1 were skewed differently in the superﬁcial compared to the deeper cortical layers. Second, we used SWM to analyze responses evoked by stimuli or microsaccades even when the onset timing of stimulus or microsaccades was unknown.
Comparison with existing methods: We ﬁrst validated the method on simulated datasets, and we checked that for recordings with a sufﬁciently low noise level the SWM results were consistent with results from the widely used phase alignment (PA) method.
Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed method has wide applicability in the exploration of noisy time series data where the onset times of particular events are unknown by the experimenter such as in resting state and sleep recordings.},

	abstract = {Brain rhythms are nearly always analyzed in the spectral domain in terms of their power, phase, and frequency. While this conventional approach has uncovered spike-field coupling, as well as correlations to normal behaviors and pathological states, emerging work has highlighted the physiological and behavioral importance of multiple novel oscillation features. Oscillatory bursts, for example, uniquely index a variety of cognitive states, and the nonsinusoidal shape of oscillations relate to physiological changes, including Parkinson's disease. Open questions remain regarding how bursts and nonsinusoidal features relate to circuit-level processes, and how they interrelate. By analyzing unit and local field recordings in the rodent hippocampus, we uncover a number of significant relationships between oscillatory bursts, nonsinusoidal waveforms, and local inhibitory and excitatory spiking patterns. Bursts of theta oscillations are surprisingly related to a decrease in pyramidal neuron synchrony, and have no detectable effect on firing sequences, despite significant increases in neuronal firing rates during periods of theta bursting. Theta burst duration is predicted by the asymmetries of its first cycle, and cycle asymmetries relate to firing rate, synchrony, and sequences of pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These results provide compelling physiological evidence that time-domain features, of both nonsinusoidal hippocampal theta waveform and the theta bursting state, reflects local circuit properties. These results point to the possibility of inferring circuit states from local field potential features in the hippocampus and perhaps other brain regions with other rhythms.},
