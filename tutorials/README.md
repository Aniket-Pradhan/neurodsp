# neurodsp Tutorials Index

The neurodsp tutorials are spread out across a series of notebooks, which demonstrate the sequence of analysis you might adopt with using each of the modules. Each tutorial aims to be short and to the point about a particular aspect of idea and module.

- [Filtering](1-Filtering.ipynb)
    - A general tutorial on filtering, filter parameters, and our specific implementation.

- [Instantaneous Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase](2-InstantaneousMeasures.ipynb)
    - Computing instantaneous features, such as amplitude, phase, and frequency, from narrowband-filtered (putative) oscillations.

- [Lagged Coherence](3-LaggedCoherence.ipynb)
    - FOO

- [Spectral Analysis](4-SpectralAnalysis.ipynb)
    - FOO & fooof.

- [Burst Detection](5-BurstDetection.ipynb)
    - FOO & bycycle.

- [Sliding Window Matching](6-SlidingWindowMatching.ipynb)
    - FOO.

- [Simulating Oscillations Embedded in 1/f Background](7-SimulatingSignals.ipynb)
    - FOO.
