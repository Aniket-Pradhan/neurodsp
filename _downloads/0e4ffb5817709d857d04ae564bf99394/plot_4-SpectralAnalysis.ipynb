As well as a large body of\nwork investigating oscillations, this \"1/f-like\" aperiodic components has been found to\ncorrelate with aging, memory, and cognitive control in several previous publications,\nand has been proposed to reflect the physiological  balance between excitation and inhibition.\n\nSee for example: Voytek et al., JNeuro, 2015; Podvalny et al.,\nJNeurophysiol, 2015; Gao et al., NeuroImage, 2017; Lombardi et al., Chaos, 2017\n\nIf you are interesting in measuring these periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic\n(1/f like) components from power spectra, check out the 'fitting oscillations &\none-over f' `toolbox <https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/>`_.\n\n\n"
