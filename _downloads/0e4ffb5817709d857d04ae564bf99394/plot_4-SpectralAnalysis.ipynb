In this toolbox, there are a few\nways of estimating the PSD:\n- 'mean' : same as Welch's method; mean over spectrogram of data.\n  This is the most straightforward and \"standard\" way of computing the PSD.\n- 'median' : similar to Welch's method; median (instead of mean) over\n  spectrogram of data.
